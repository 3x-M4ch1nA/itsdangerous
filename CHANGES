It's Dangerous Changelog
------------------------

Version 0.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an uncought value error.

Version 0.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Refactored interface that the underlying serializers can be swapped by
  passing in a module instead of having to override the payload loaders
  and dumpers.  This makes the interface more compatible with Django's
  recent changes.
